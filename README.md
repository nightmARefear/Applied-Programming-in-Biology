This project aims to predict the HIV subtype of a given sequence. Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There are two types of HIV: HIV-1, the most common, and HIV-2. The focus of this project is on the first type, HIV-1, which is divided into four groups: M, N, O and P. The most important group M (-Major) is the primary group responsible for the global epidemic and it is divided into the following subtypes: A, B, C, D, F, G, J, K and CRFs. Out of these subtypes, the focus will be primarily on A, B, C and D.
